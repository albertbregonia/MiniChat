# MiniChat
## A Simple, Peer-to-Peer, TCP-Based Chat App

What began as a my first entry into learning programming sockets and internet-based devices. I decided to spruce up this project and publish it as a useful little tool.

### Note: If you are to use this software you must:
- Either, know how to port-forward or know someone that does.
- Understand that traffic is ***NOT*** encrypted when messages are sent using this software.
- Understand that this software was ***NOT*** meant to be a chat app between people.

**MiniChat** is written in C# using the .NET Framework. It exemplifies the fundamentals of socket programming and its main purpose is to be a debugging tool whilst working with internet capable devices. Even a very simple network program like this, requires a lot of error-checking in order to be robust.

## Main Features:
1. Configurable to be a server or client
2. Easy to use GUI
3. Portable and installer versions are available.

Please check the "**Final**" folder if you wish to simply download the Installer or Portable version instead of looking at the source code.
